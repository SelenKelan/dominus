# Relay Trigger on RPi 3 for Embedded system and Domoticz
This is for the Embedded system course at ENSTA Bretagne.

## Version 2

Basic script to trigger on or off a GPIO (GPIO17)

### To compile:

```
  sudo make v2
```
It will create two binaries : gpion and gpioff.

### To use :

You can chose the pin you want to trigger:

```
  ./gpion -g 17 // if you want to trigger on the GPIO 17
  ./gpioff -g 17 // if you want to trigger off the GPIO 17
```

### And with Bash :

the *onoff.sh* script is an exemple of use with bash to make it work with Domoticz.
